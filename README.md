# Best 11 Cricket Players Team all around the world
In this project we have make a team of Best 11 cricket players from all around the world on the basis of their last T20 (2022) performance. This project will help lots of cricket enthusiasts to select the best players on their past performance.

# Description:
As a data analyst, I conducted an analysis of the top T-20 cricket players to determine the best 11 players for a hypothetical T-20 team. The analysis involved gathering data on player statistics, including batting average, strike rate, bowling average, economy rate, fielding statistics, and overall performance in T-20 matches. I cleaned and processed the data using SQL and Python to prepare it for analysis.

I then used statistical analysis techniques such as regression analysis and clustering to identify the key factors that contributed to a player's performance and overall value to the team. Based on these factors, I developed a model to predict the best 11 players for the T-20 team.

To visualize the results of the analysis, I created interactive dashboards using Tableau. The dashboards provided a summary of the key insights from the analysis and allowed stakeholders to explore the data and make informed decisions about player selection.

Overall, this project demonstrated my ability to perform complex data analysis, use statistical techniques to gain insights, and communicate the results effectively through data visualization.
